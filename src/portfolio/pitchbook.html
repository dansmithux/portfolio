  <h2>Projects</h2>

  <p>The following are a collection of tools and applications I designed and developed to enhance data coverage, help acquire exclusive company insights, improve data quality using data science, and achieve rapid processing beyond human capabilities through advanced computer science and machine learning methods</p>


  <h3>Screenshot Generator</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Built to improve private company survey process</li>
    <li>Time needed to create 120 screenshots for survey emails:
      <ul>
        <li>Manually: ~90 minutes</li>
        <li>Using Screenshot Generator: ~4 minutes</li>
        <li><strong>2,250%</strong> speed improvement</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Process is automatic; researcher can do other tasks during 4 minutes</li>
    <li>Used temporary user interface</li>
    <li>Integrated into internal workflow software, further improving speed</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Primary Report Tool</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Updated Report Tool interface for Primary Research team to have in front of them during calls</li>
    <li>Updated user interface to increase legibility and usability</li>
    <li>Displaying most relevant data points with customized & prioritized ordering and highlighting</li>
    <li>Implemented “Export to Excel” feature to streamline note-taking and data entry accuracy</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Survey Profile Editor</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Redesigned and enhanced survey tool for better user interaction with data</li>
    <li>Concept gives many more people a preview of what PitchBook looks like</li>
    <li>Clean, intuitive interface allows for simple data editing and confirmation</li>
    <li>Introductory guided interaction flow will be added to ensure most important data points are entered/confirmed by survey contact</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-1">Profile Editor is a replica of PitchBook platform, but with editable fields (hovering over value shows editability)</p>

  <p class="mt-1">Clicking on a value will transform it into an appropriate input field (textbox, dropdown menu, etc.)</p>


  <h3>News as a Service (NaaS)</h3>

  <p>The NaaS interface was used as a primary application by full-time researchers and research managers, in order to identify key sentences about company events and key financial data points (e.g. revenue, EBITDA, funding rounds, employee count) from various news sources, capture that data, and validate/improve the accuracy of the machine learning models.</p>
