<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Alpha-1 Foundation (A1F) funds research for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) – a rare genetic disorder that elevates the risk of lung and liver diseases, occurring in approximately 1 in every 2,000 to 5,000 individuals. A1F promotes early detection through genetic testing and studies, supports a DNA and tissue bank and research registry, and is affiliated with over 80 clinical centers that offer specialized care to individuals with AATD. They also provide medical education to healthcare professionals and patient education through regional events, literature, and referrals.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>A1F needed their website completely redesigned to alleviate some of the following issues:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Website was dated, difficult to update, with many broken pages and features</li>
    <li>Disorganized &amp; duplicate information (multiple instances of polyhierarchy), unreadable content, and lack of mobile responsiveness</li>
    <li>Low user engagement and conversion</li>
    <li>Inability to capture basic user data was negatively affecting fundraising and research efforts</li>
    <li>Was not easy for staff to update</li>
</ul>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Improve modernity, general functionality &amp; mobile responsiveness</li>
    <li>Consolidate duplicate content, simplify information architecture, increase information discoverability</li>
    <li>Increase donations and fundraising efforts</li>
    <li>Increase genetic testing and awareness of AATD &mdash; target younger audience, possibly undiagnosed people starting families</li>
    <li>Increase email newsletter signup conversion</li>
</ul>

<h3>Team</h3>
<p>The team for this project consisted of a:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Project owner / copywriter</li>
    <li>Project manager / copywriter</li>
    <li>WordPress developer</li>
    <li>Visual designer</li>
    <li>UX lead (UX researcher &amp; UX designer)</li>
    <li>Junior UX researcher</li>
    <li>Junior UX designer</li>
</ul>



<h2>Research &amp; Discovery</h2>

<p>To address both user needs and business objectives effectively, we devised a research approach that combines both quantitative and qualitative research methods.</p>

<h3>User Survey</h3>

<h4>Key takeaways</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Comprehensive information hub</strong>: users appreciate the website's extensive Alpha-1 information, finding it relevant, useful, and informative.</li>
    <li><strong>Relevance across disease journey</strong>: the site effectively caters to users at various stages of their Alpha-1 journey, offering valuable content that evolves with their understanding.</li>
    <li><strong>Community support</strong>: the website fosters a strong sense of community, evident in the positive feedback that highlights its role in creating a supportive environment.</li>
    <li><strong>Addressing information gaps</strong>: The website bridges the information gap left by healthcare professionals regarding Alpha-1, offering unique insights not readily available elsewhere.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhanced usability</strong>: users express concerns about overwhelming content, non-intuitive navigation, and mobile-unfriendly design. Improving organization and mobile responsiveness can enhance user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Effective information management</strong>: implementing user-friendly navigation and organized content structures can address the challenge of overwhelming information, making content easier to discover and explore.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>

<h3>Design Principles Workshop</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Design principles &amp; feature prioritization based on survey and heuristic evaluation</li>
    <li>Participants: staff / stakeholders of A1F</li>
    <li>Prompted with 3 “how might [we]…” questions to engage empathetically with users</li>
</ul>

<h4>Finalized design principles</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Simplicity &amp; minimalism to help offset potential pre-existing overwhelm</li>
    <li>Intuitive structure to help people efficiently find the information they need</li>
    <li>Empathic &amp; sensitive to user needs</li>
    <li>Data-driven to solve the right problems</li>
    <li>Accessibility &amp; inclusivity as a focus (ADA compliance)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Target audience [might reorder to another section]</h4>
<p>From survey results and stakeholder workshop / discussions, decided primary audiences for redesign would be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Individuals newly diagnosed with AATD, seeking information and resources</li>
    <li>Undiagnosed individuals; those seeking testing and genetic counseling</li>
</ul>

<h4>Prioritized features [might reorder to another section]</h4>
<p>From survey results, heuristic evaluation, and stakeholder workshop / discussions, decided most impactful features would be:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Specialist map &amp; support group map with gated content to improve lead generation</li>
    <li>Resource library
        <ul>
            <li>Searchable resource section for users to find relevant literature and materials about AATD</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Video library
        <ul>
            <li>Library of video content, searchable and filterable by events, speakers, topics</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Calendar of events</li>
    <li>News / blog</li>
    <li>Redesigned donation form</li>
</ul>

<h3>Google Analytics Review</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Visitor engagement: vast majority of visitors spent 0–10 seconds on site</li>
    <li>High bounce rate: many users were not engaging with the site</li>
    <li>Content drilldown: A1F site had over 700 pages of content; traffic dropped off significantly in the top 20 pages</li>
    <li>Demographics: insights differed from user experience survey results, suggesting different audience for newsletter / Facebook vs. website traffic</li>
</ul>

<h3>Open card sort</h3>
<p>Hypothesis: based on established best practices and research, audience-segmented navigation creates confusion and forces users to self-identify into an audience category, while the information they seek could fall under multiple audience categories</p>

<p>Card sort on UXTweak research platform:</p>
<p><img src="/static/img/screenshot-2023-08-10-at-12.59.43-pm.png" alt="Screenshot of A1F card sort" title="Screenshot of A1F card sort"></p>

<h4>Results</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Validated hypothesis, showing that no respondents intrinsically sorted information into audience-segmented categories</li>
    <li>Detracting factors for card sort:
        <ul>
            <li>"Alpha-1" prefix on individual cards created grouping bias and compromised value of data</li>
            <li>Ambiguity of some individual cards compromised value of data (e.g. jargon, branding – difficult for new users to understand definitions)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Respondent-Centric Analysis (RCA): explored similarity of responses at varying thresholds to find patterns:</li>
</ul>
