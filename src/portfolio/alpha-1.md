## Introduction

### Background

* The Alpha-1 Foundation (A1F) funds research for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) – a rare genetic disorder that elevates the risk of lung and liver diseases, occurring in approximately 1 in every 2,000 to 5,000 individuals. A1F promotes early detection through genetic testing and studies, supports a DNA and tissue bank and research registry, and is affiliated with over 80 clinical centers that offer specialized care to individuals with AATD. They also provide medical education to healthcare professionals and patient education through regional events, literature, and referrals.

### Problems

A1F needed their website completely redesigned to alleviate some of the following issues:

* Website was dated, difficult to update, with many broken pages and features
* Disorganized & duplicate information (multiple instances of polyhierarchy), unreadable content, and lack of mobile responsiveness
* Low user engagement and conversion
* Inability to capture basic user data was negatively affecting fundraising and research efforts
* Was not easy for staff to update

### Goals

* Improve modernity, general functionality & mobile responsiveness
* Consolidate duplicate content, simplify information architecture, increase information discoverability
* Increase donations and fundraising efforts
* Increase genetic testing and awareness of AATD

  * Target younger audience, possibly undiagnosed people starting families
* Increase email newsletter signup conversion

#### Target audience

Based on stakeholder interviews & survey results

* Individuals newly diagnosed with AATD, seeking information and resources
* Undiagnosed individuals; those seeking testing and genetic counseling

#### Prioritized features

Based on user research, workshops, and stakeholder discussion, features with the greatest impact were:

* Specialist map

  * Gated content / lead generation
* Support group map

  * Gated content / lead generation
* Resource library

  * Searchable resource section for users to find relevant information and materials about Alpha-1 and related topics
* Video library

  * Library of video content, searchable and filterable by events, speakers, topics
* Calendar
* News
* Donations

### Google Analytics Review

### Open card sort

Hypothesis: based on established best practices and research, audience-segmented navigation creates confusion and forces users to self-identify into an audience category, while the information they seek could fall under multiple audience categories

#### Results

* Validated hypothesis, showing that no respondents intrinsically sorted information into audience-segmented categories
* Detracting factors for card sort:

  * “Alpha-1” prefix on individual cards created grouping bias and compromised value of data
  * Ambiguity of some individual cards compromised value of data (e.g. jargon, branding – difficult for new users to understand definitions)
* Respondent-Centric Analysis (RCA): explored similarity of responses at varying thresholds to find patterns:
