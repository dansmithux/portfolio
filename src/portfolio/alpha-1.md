## Introduction

### Background

* The Alpha-1 Foundation (A1F) funds research for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) â€“ a rare genetic disorder that elevates the risk of lung and liver diseases, occurring in approximately 1 in every 2,000 to 5,000 individuals. A1F promotes early detection through genetic testing and studies, supports a DNA and tissue bank and research registry, and is affiliated with over 80 clinical centers that offer specialized care to individuals with AATD. They also provide medical education to healthcare professionals and patient education through regional events, literature, and referrals.

### Problems

A1F needed their website completely redesigned to alleviate some of the following issues:

* Website was dated, difficult to update, with many broken pages and features
* Disorganized & duplicate information (multiple instances of polyhierarchy), unreadable content, and lack of mobile responsiveness
* Low user engagement and conversion
* Inability to capture basic user data was negatively affecting fundraising and research efforts
* Was not easy for staff to update

### Goals

* Improve modernity, general functionality & mobile responsiveness
* Consolidate duplicate content, simplify information architecture, increase information discoverability
* Increase donations and fundraising efforts
* Increase genetic testing and awareness of AATD

  * Target younger audience, possibly undiagnosed people starting families
* Increase email newsletter signup conversion
