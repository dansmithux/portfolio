# Introduction

## Background

* The Alpha-1 Foundation (A1F) funds research on lung and liver diseases associated with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency. It supports a DNA and tissue bank, genetics laboratory, and research registry for participants. A1F promotes early detection through testing programs like family testing and the Alpha-1 Coded Testing Study. Over 80 clinical centers affiliated with A1F offer specialized care to individuals with Alpha-1. The organization provides medical education to healthcare professionals and patient education through regional events, brochures, and referrals. A1F also advocates for legislative issues concerning Alpha-1.

  * Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is a rare genetic disorder that elevate the risk of lung and liver diseases, occurring in approximately 1 in every 2,000 to 5,000 individuals, though the actual number might be higher due to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. It is crucial to undergo testing for AATD, particularly for those with a family history or unexplained lung/liver issues. Early diagnosis enables the implementation of appropriate management strategies, including lifestyle changes and targeted therapies, to mitigate disease progression and enhance long-term outcomes.

## Client challenges

* Website is dated, difficult to update, with broken pages and features
* Fails to fully reflect A1F's offerings and meet stakeholder needs
* Poor UX: disorganized & duplicate information, unreadable content, and lack of mobile responsiveness
* Low user engagement and conversion
* Inability to capture basic user data negatively affects fundraising and research efforts
